Python, an undoutedly user-friendly language, fast, convenient and most importantly, easy to learn and to code, has been increasingly popular in earth science research for the past few years. 

My long way of self-learning Python started in late 2015,  when I was about to graduate from the master program of Chinese Academy of Meteorological Science. Since then , I've written roughly tens of thousands of Python codes to meet the need from meteorological research .Although what I did is mainly for data processing and visualization using short scripts, I've also developed a software  to integrate both those functions that contains nearly.

This repository , named "The hut of Python", is for me to store the Python codes that I find helpful. Some of the codes are original , and others may not. Hopefully,this repository would play as a helpful solution list once I or other users encounter the same problmes or have the similar projects to finish.
