# The-hut-of-Python
Python, an undoutedly user-friendly language, fast, convenient and most importantly, easy to learn and to code, has been increasingly popular in earth science research for the past few years. 

My course of self-learning Python kicks off in late 2015,  when I was about to graduate from the master program of Chinese Academy of Meteorological Science. Since then , I've been writing Python codes to meet the need from meteorological research .Although what I did is mainly for data processing and visualization with short scripts, I've also developed a software  to integrate both those functions.

This repository , named "The hut of Python", is for me to store the Python codes that I've used or found helpful in future application.
